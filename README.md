# VBScripts
Simple Visual Basic Scripts for use in IpSwitch MoveIt product.
My company used MoveIt for centralized and automated managed filed transmissions.  The product works really well without customization, but there are a few instances where the incoming or outgoing files just won't work with the systems they are being imported into.  In that case, we write VBScripts to accomodate.  Types of issues are page breaks, line feeds, carriage return feeds, etc.
